function [D,pos_tonodeID] = write_adj_matrix(fromN,toN,lgth)
%write_adj_matrix This function takes a two vectors of from-nodes and to-nodes transfers them into a (sparse) adjacency matrix . Each pair of from-nodes and to-nodes
%%% defines a river reach. Vectors need to be of equal size. 

%%% The function works both 1) the downstream, and 2) the upstream
%%% direction. In case to, the toN is the vector of from-nodes and fromN
%%% must be the vector of to-nodes. 

%%% Input: 
% FromN: Vector of from-nodes
% toN: Vector of to-nodes


%%% Output
% D: Sparse adjacency matrix 
% pos_tonodeID: Sorting index to make sure that the position of a reach and
% its from-Node are identical (i.e., that reach 465 is on the 465th
% position in the data).
